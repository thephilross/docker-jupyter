# Jupyter Notebook Stack

## What it Gives You

* Jupyter Notebook server v3.2.x
* Python 3.4.x
* Python 2.7.x
* R 3.2.x
* Julia 0.3.2
* Options for HTTPS, password auth, and passwordless `sudo`

## Basic Use

The following command starts a container with the Notebook server listening for HTTP connections on port 8888 without authentication configured.

```
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 thephilross/jupyter
```

## Options

You may customize the execution of the Docker container and the Notebook server it contains with the following optional arguments.

* `-e PASSWORD="YOURPASS"` - Configures Jupyter Notebook to require the given password. Should be combined with `USE_HTTPS` on untrusted networks.
* `-e USE_HTTPS=yes` - Configures Jupyter Notebook to accept encrypted HTTPS connections. If a `pem` file containing a SSL certificate and key is not found in `/home/phil/.ipython/profile_default/security/notebook.pem`, the container will generate a self-signed certificate for you.
* `-e GRANT_SUDO=yes` - Gives the `phil` user passwordless `sudo` capability. Useful for installing OS packages. **You should only enable `sudo` if you trust the user or if the container is running on an isolated host.**
* `-v /some/host/folder/for/work:/home/phil/work` - Host mounts the default working directory on the host to preserve work even when the container is destroyed and recreated (e.g., during an upgrade).
* `-v /some/host/folder/for/server.pem:/home/phil/.ipython/profile_default/security/notebook.pem` - Mounts a SSL certificate plus key for `USE_HTTPS`. Useful if you have a real certificate for the domain under which you are running the Notebook server.
